    This is a mockup of a terrible online text editor.  Essentially, you provide a name and description of the code snippet on the left and the code itself in the central text area.  You may switch between the <b>Light Mode</b> and <b>Dark Mode</b> for this application through the tabs at the top; switching to the <b>Light Mode</b> shall be referred to as <i>enlightenment</i> and switching to the <b>Dark Mode</b> shall be referred to as <i>endarkenment</i>.  You have also successfully reached the unhelpful <b>Help</b> page for this application.
